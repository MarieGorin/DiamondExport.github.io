      <h5 class="mt-0">First step</h5>
      <p>We meet with diamond exporters at the source, in conflict-free African countries,
        to observe, evaluate and select, one by one, each diamond from the presented batch.<br></p>
      <p>To ensure the origin of our diamonds, we work with trusted local exporters
        who know exactly from what mining site each piece has been extracted from
        and can easily trace back their places of provenance.
        That is how we are able to commit to the Kimberley agreement.</p>

      <p>We retrieve our agreed batch directly from our local partner 
        and transit them through safe urban areas to receive the approved and legit certificates.<br></p>
      <p>We make sure the money we pay diamonds with goes to the right people,
        so as to ensure economic development in African countries and support every worker's wages.
        We care about the safety and comfort at work of the miners and their families at home,
        by signing deals with trustworthy and anti-violence reprensatives.</p>

      <p>We export our diamonds from Africa and securely ship them by plane to Hong Kong, 
        where we double-check their quality and purity.<br></p>
        <p>To mitigate risks, we resort to high security measures.
          No matter where the diamonds come from, they go through a first checkpoint in Tanzania
          to asses once again there are no counterfeit or synthetic in our batch
          and that each piece meets with our clients' requirements.<br></p>
         <p>Hong Kong is our second checkpoint, and it is only there that our license to export can be retrieved
          after every single piece of the batch has been approved by the adequat authorities.</p>

      <p>We move our diamonds to India where they are within the hands of expert jewelers, 
        and individually refined, polished and cleaned to take the famous yet various diamond shapes.<br></p>
      <p>We adapt our techniques for every piece, because each diamond needs specific care.
        We seek for the shapes and cuts that can enhance the natural beauty of our diamonds,
        to reveal their elegance and brightness, making them the perfect piece of jewelry for you.</p>

      <p>Our diamonds are shipped to Singapore, where we ensure their quality and purity one last time 
        while gathering the appropriate trading documents for several continets.<br></p>
      <p>Each piece runs through a series of test to ensure their beauty will never fade.
        We then divide our batch in smaller package meeting each of our market's preferences and trends,
        but offering still enough variety in sapes, sizes and colors
        to ensure that every customer finds that perfect diamond.</p>

        piece by piece and directly from our hand, in Singapore, Hong Kong, and the USA - for the moment.<br></p>
      <p>We value our customer's taste and feedbacks as much as we guide them through their choices.

        the perfect piece that fits your wishes in no time.
